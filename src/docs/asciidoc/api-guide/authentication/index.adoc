= Authentication

The Boclips API authorization is based on https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect (OIDC)]. Alternatively,
we support https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language[SAML] too.

OIDC is an additional layer on top of https://www.oauth.com/[OAuth 2.0] that enables user information access.

The first step of using Boclips API in your application is obtaining an access token. Depending on the type of integration,
we can provide different https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/[OAuth grant types].

Boclips will provide you with a `client_id` and, depending on the integration, a `client_secret`.

Regardless of how the access token is retrieved, the structure of the response will look like this:
