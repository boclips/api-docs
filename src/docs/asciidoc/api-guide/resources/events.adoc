== Events

Boclips API supports events.
They can be published using standard REST calls and are later used for analytics and reporting purposes.

=== Playback events

The most important type of Boclips events are playback events as they allow us to track video usage for billing purposes.

==== Sending single playback event

If you're using our web player, it will publish these events for you automatically, no extra work required.

If, however, you need to use a custom player, then you'll need to publish those events yourself.
Each video playback contains a `createPlaybackEvent` link that you can use to POST data to our events endpoint.

To accommodate for cases where user closes the app before a playback event can be submitted, playback events can be split into smaller chunks and uploaded one by one.

==== Sending a batch of playback events

If you're using a custom video player and you prefer to send a batch of playback events you can do so given you possess the permission.

The batch events endpoint can be found under the <<resources-index-access_links,`createPlaybackEvents`>> link of the API index.

As the batch upload of events happens in retrospect, you must include the `captureTime` of video property in POST request.
This property describes when the event occurred (not when the batch upload is issued).

The `captureTime` represents an https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime[ISO 8601] formatted string including year, month, day, hour, second, nanosecond and time zone. For example: `1997-07-16T19:20:30.45+01:00`.
