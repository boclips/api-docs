[[authenticating-with-api]]
== Authenticating with the API

Our auth systems are based on https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/[OAuth 2.0^] and the credentials required to authenticate are the *client id* and *secret*. Currently, there isn't a self-served portal that will provide you with these, so our team will share them with you directly.

Once you have them, you can acquire an access token by issuing a request below:

include::{snippets}/client-credentials-example/http-request.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
Please note that the request needs to be sent with the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type to be processed correctly.

Here's a CURL request if you feel like giving it a spin:

include::{snippets}/client-credentials-example/curl-request.adoc[]

This will give you back a JSON response similar to the one below:

[source,json]
{
  "access_token": "***",
  "expires_in": 300, <1>
  ...
}

<1> _Access token's lifetime expressed in seconds_

The value of the `access_token` field then needs to be attached as the `Bearer` token of the HTTP `Authorization` header to authorise the actual API requests, for example:

include::{snippets}/resource-video/http-request.adoc[]
