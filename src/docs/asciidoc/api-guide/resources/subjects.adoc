[[resources-subjects]]
== Subjects

The subject resource lists subjects that Boclips offers to tag videos or other relevant resources.
This resource can also be used to filter by subject.

=== Retrieving user-relevant subjects

By taking user context into account, only subjects that contain non-empty video results will be returned.
Subjects with empty video results are skipped.

operation::resource-subjects-user[snippets='http-request,curl-request,http-response,response-fields,links']

=== Retrieving all subjects

All existing subjects will be returned, regardless of user context.
