== Integrating the Boclips Player into your web app

In order to integrate our video player into your web application, you're going to need just a couple of things:

. a way to fetch Boclips API access tokens (described link:authenticating.html[here] and link:calling-the-api.html[here]),
. the Boclips player sources,
. a video to display!

Now let's see how to put this together and show a playable video to your users! ðŸ›

        const container = document.querySelector('#container'); <2>
        const playerOptions = {
          api: {
            tokenFactory: () => YourService.getBoclipsAccessToken() <3>
          }
        }
        const player = Boclips.PlayerFactory.get(container, playerOptions);
        player.loadVideo('https://api.boclips.com/v1/videos/5c542aba5438cdbcb56de630'); <4>
      };
      window.onload = (_event) => renderPlayer();

<1> _Player sources_
<2> _A container to render the player in_
<3> _A factory function to return Boclips API tokens_
<4> _Loading the video into the player (URL hardcoded for simplicity, consider using link:/api-guide/index.html#overview-hypermedia[links^] instead)_

Above is a minimal example that you can copy to get yourself started quickly.

Our player repository contains a few https://github.com/boclips/boclips-player/tree/main/demo[demo projects^] too â€” give them a go if you're interested in the different ways of setting it up.
