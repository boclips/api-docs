== Events

Boclips API supports events. They can be published using standard REST calls and are later used for analytics and reporting purposes.

=== Playback events

The most important type of Boclips events are playback events as they allow us to track video usage for billing purposes.

If you're using our web player, it will publish these events for you automatically, no extra work required. If, however, you need to use a custom player, then you'll need to publish those events yourself. Each video playback contains a `createPlaybackEvent` link that you can use to POST data to our events endpoint.

To accommodate for cases where user closes the app before a playback event can be submitted, playback events can be split into smaller chunks and uploaded one by one.
