[[resources-index]]
== Index

The index provides the entry point into the service. It returns a set of links that describe which actions are available to you as the API user.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The lists of links that are returned depend on your *API subscription tier*, so not all of the features described below may be available to you. They're also dependant on *resource states*.

The best way to handle the API integration is by assuming that links may come and go and disabling/enabling features as necessary.

[[resources-index-access]]
