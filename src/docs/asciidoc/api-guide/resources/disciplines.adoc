== Disciplines

The discipline resource groups subjects together. Each discipline will contain a list of subjects.

=== Retrieving user-relevant disciplines

By taking user context into account, only disciplines with subjects that contain non-empty video results will be returned.
Subjects with empty video results are skipped, which in turn leads to omitting disciplines with no subjects.

operation::resource-disciplines-user-get[snippets='http-request,curl-request,http-response,response-fields,links']

=== Retrieving all disciplines

All existing disciplines with all their subjects will be returned, regardless of user context.
