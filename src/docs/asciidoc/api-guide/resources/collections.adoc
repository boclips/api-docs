== Collections

Collections allow to group related videos together and attach some additional metadata to them. They can be searched through, edited and bookmarked.

[[resources-collections-create]]
=== Creating a collection

Collections can be created by issuing a `POST` request to a `createCollection` link. Input parameters are provided via a JSON payload.

Upon success, the API will respond with a `201` status and provide a link to the newly created collection under a `Location` response header.
