== Collections

Collections enable grouping related videos together and have some additional metadata that describes their content. They are searchable, can be edited and bookmarked.

Each collection can be *public* or *private*. A public collection will be visible to all authenticated users through the search capability. Private collections will be visible only to their *owner*, i.e. user who created them.

=== Creating a collection

Collections can be created by issuing a `POST` request to a `createCollection` link. Input parameters are provided via a JSON payload.

Upon success, the API will respond with a `201` status and provide a link to the newly created collection under a `Location` response header.
